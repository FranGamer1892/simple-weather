# Simple Weather

A very simple weather app made with Rust and GTK4. Do not forget to set the API KEY under src/window.rs before compiling! (Pro tip for building: just open the project in [GNOME Builder](https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/introduction/builder.html))

## How does it work?

Basically, the program fetches your public IP address, determines your approximate coordinates, and uses them to retrieve weather information in your area.
